# Uber Supply Demand Gap / Exploratory Data Analysis
BUSINESS OBJECTIVE

You have an emergency to reach a destination point, but unfortunately no cabs are available or maybe cancelled by cab driver. Most of us faced this situation in our real life, while travelling to Airport or Railway station etc. This will surely effect the revenue and reputation of Uber. Main objective of this case study is to find the actual reason (or) cause of unavailability of the cars. I will try to identify the this problem uber is facing and recommend ways to improve the situation
Data attributes

There are six attributes associated with each request made by a customer:

1) Request id : A unique identifies of the request

2) Time of request(request timestamp): The date and time at which customer made the trip request

3) Drop-off time (drop timestamp): The drop-off date and time, in case the trip was completed

4) Pickup-up point: The point from which the request was made

5) Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver

6) Status of the request: The final status of the trip, that can be either completed , cancelled by the driver or no cars available

# NOTE
For this study only the trips to and from the airport is considered
